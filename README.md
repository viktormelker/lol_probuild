# ProbuildEx

I followed [a guide](https://mrdotb.com/posts/probuild-ex-part-one) to set this up.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

## Prerequisites
- Get an **API key** from [Riot](https://developer.riotgames.com)
